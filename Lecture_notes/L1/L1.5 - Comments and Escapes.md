# Lecture 1.6 - Comments and Escapes
## Comments
Every now and then, a developer wants to add a tiny bit of information to their code that is not <i>actual</i> code. This is where comments come into handy. They let you enter text messages in your code segments that are ignored by the compiler. The standard comment character in Java is a double slash `//`. This signals that whatever comes after this, on the same row, is to be ignored in the compiling procedure.

```
// First, we declare and assign two integer variables a and b.
int a = 5; 
int b = 10;

// Then we add the variables a and b together.
int sum = a + b;

// Finally, we print the resulting sum to the terminal.
System.out.println(sum);
```

Comments can also be added in the middle of a row. Like this: `int a = 5; // This is where the variable a is declared and assigned its value.`. Here, the variable is declared and assigned normally, and everything after the double slash is ignored.

Another useful kind of comment is the block comment. This is started by `/*` and then exited by its inverse `*/`. Anything written in between the slashes will be ignored by the compiler, no matter what row it is on.

```
int a = 5;

/* Here is a
multi-line
comment!
*/

System.out/* You can even have a block comment in the middle of a statement!*/.println(a);
```

It is common for a beginner programmer to introduce lots of comments in their code. This is a good practice... when you are learning! Introducing comments helps reinforcing your learning procedure. However, you may read about commenting of code as frowned upon within professional coding communities. There is good reason to this. Since comments never execute (and therefore can easily be forgotten) they tend to linger and introduce confusion and/or errors if they are kept lying around in production-level code. As you progress in your level of expertise as a programmer, aim at writing readable, understandable code instead, and commenting will prove less necessary to explain what your code does! We will touch a little bit more on this by the end of course when we talk about the Clean Code paradigm.

## Escapes
An escape is a way of telling the compiler that what comes next is not supposed to be interpreted in its "normal" way. A typical use for escapes is within Strings. The standard escape character in Java is the slash `/`. If you want to make for example a new line in your string, you do that by typing `\n`:

See how the string myString is stored as a sequence of characters, incuding our `\n` escape code for a new line. But then, when it is compiled and printed in the `println()` statement, upon execution, the `\n` is interpreted as a new line!

A useful escape character is `\"`, which produces a quotation sign. Remember, if you use a quotation sign without the escape `\` you will just end your string! Check out the following examples. In the first attempt, we did not use the escape character, and Java tells us there is a syntax error because it believes (rightfully so!) that the string has ended. In the second example, we introduce the escape character, and it all works out as we intended!

There are a number of escape characters in Java, which can be found in the Java documentation <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html">here</a>.
