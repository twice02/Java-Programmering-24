# L6.2 - Interface
In the last chapter we introduced inheritance and the `extends` keyword in order to introduce type polymorphism in Java. Another way to introduce polymorphism to a class is to use the `interface` keyword. An interface is a contract of sorts for a class, which states that the class must implement a certain set of variables and/or methods. Consider an adventure game where we can use different types of weapons. We create a single class for each weapon (`Sword`, `Spear`, `Club`, etc.). Now, we want to call on our weapon object from an `Attack()`-method in our `Adventurer` class. Instead of implementing a method signature for each weapon-type (`Attack(Sword s)`, `Attack(Spear s)`, `Attack(Club c)`, etc.) we can use an interface and let that represent all of our weapons. Let's see it in action:

## Declaring an interface
An interface is declared in the same way as a class or an enum, by using the `interface` keyword:

![Weapon](/assets/lecture_6/Weapon.png)

The above example declares a simple interface called `Weapon`. This interface tells the compiler that any class that implements it is supposed to have two methods called `Attack()` and `Drop()` that both return `void`. To implement the interface, we use the keyword `implements` when we declare our class:

![Sword](/assets/lecture_6/Sword.png)

Here, we declare a new class, `Sword` and let it implement the `Weapon` interface. Since we did so, we also have to specify the `Attack()` and `Drop()` methods. If we do not create the methods required for the interface the compiler will produce an error message. When we do this, it means that our new class `Sword` can create obects that are not only of type `Sword`, but that can also be treated as being of type `Weapon`. 

This can be useful in e.g. our actual adventurer class:

![Adventurer](/assets/lecture_6/Adventurer.png)

See how we use a method here that takes a `Weapon`-type variable as its argument. If we would not have the `Weapon`-interface, we would need to create a `playerAttack()`-method for each new weapon-type. Instead, if we let each weapon implement then `Weapon`-interface, we can just create new weapons as we like, without changing the Adventurer class! Each weapon will be polymorphic in that it will be of its respective type (`Sword`, `Spear`, etc.), but of interface-type `Weapon`.

Notice how in the declaration of the interface, our methods have no code body at all, they just include the arguments list, and then end on a semi-colon. Interfaces can also include constants and static methods. All interface methods and variables are public by definition, so the `public` keyword is not necessary.
