# Lecture 2.1 - Classes - Introduction
At the core of Java programming, and at any object-oriented programming language, lies the object. The object is the means by which we can break down and compartmentalize our code, giving us the possibility of dividing our task into smaller parts. Many programming languages are object-oriented, or include object-oriented functionalities. Java was built from the bottom up, with the main intention to be entirely object-oriented, and as such, is an excellent language to get familiar with programming in an object-oriented system.

## Classes
In Java, everything (including the objects themselves) are constructed from <i>Classes</i>. A class is a code segment that can include methods, variables, initializing code, and even other classes. There are classes with very specialized purposes and large, broad general classes that serve as building blocks for more refined classes. A class can be <i>extended</i> to a new class, i.e. it's entities are transferred to a new class, which then adds on some more high-level functionality. This is called <i>inheritance</i>, and will be talked about more later on. In practice, inheritance means that every class inherits some of its core methods and variables from its parent class.

We have written two classes already, `HelloWorld` and `HelloJava` in, although likely we did not understand what a class was at that point. We have also utilized one class that is included in the base Java language, `System`. Finally, we have used two classes that we <i>imported</i> via the `javax.swing` <i>package</i>, `JFrame` and `JLabel`. We have also touched upon som other classes, e.g. `String` and `Scanner` and the made-up, empty classes, `Parrot` and `Bird`.

If you need information about a class, what methods and variables it uses, where it inherits from, etc., a good place of information is the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/index.html">Java documentation provided by Oracle.</a>.

Here, we can see a short description about the `System` class. It tells us that it deals with basic input and output (we used it for printing output!), and that it provides funcitonality for handling files, among other things. It also tells us that it is extended from the `Object` class. The `Object` class is, just as it sounds like, the mother of all classes in Java. `Object` provides all of the basic functions that defines what a class is and can do. Every single class that we import or create traces its origins back to the `Object` class!

In the documentation about `Object`, we see in the description that `Object` does indeed form the base of the class hierarchy in Java. We also see that it has been included in Java since version 1.0 (this is true for `System` as well), further proving how `Object` sits at the heart of the Java programming language!

We also see that both `System` and `Object` belong to a package, `java.lang`. Let's talk more about packages in a future lecture!
