# Lecture 2.3 - Classes - Declaring a class
Objects are at the core of an object-oriented programming language like Java. In Java, to create an instance of an object, you need a recipe. A <i>Class</i> is such a recipe. To declare a class, we use the `class` keyword (duh!), and then choose a suitable name for our newly created class, followed by a pair of curly braces (`{}`). There is a <b>very strong</b> convention to always start class names with a <b>capital letter</b>. Thus, if I want to declare a new walrus class, I would write `class Walrus {}`. This is everything you need to create your own class! The curly braces signifies the body of the class, and if it doesn't contain anything, it is not a very useful class, but it is still a class! We can now use our newly declared class to create `Walrus`-type object. Try on your own to create some classes in jshell. Use your new class(es) to create new objects with variables that reference them!

In this example I have declared two new classes, `Walrus` and `Seal`. I have also created two new variables, `stefan` and `roland`, that hold references to `Walrus` and `Seal` objects, respectively. It is not very clear at this point what the purpose of either the `Walrus` or the `Seal` class is though. We need to fill them with some initializing code!

At this point, when we start to create classes, we are about at the limit of what's practical to do within jshell. So now we leave our trusty companion behind (remember it is super-easy and very handy to just boot up jshell and try out statements when you're coding!) and move on to using the IDE itself, VSCode. Let's take <a href="lecture_notes\D2.1 - Introducing the VSCode environment.md">a very quick tour of the VSCode developing environment</a>.
