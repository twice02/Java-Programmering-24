# L6.3 - Abstract classes
An alternative to `interface` is to use <i>abstract classes</i>. An abstract class is a class that contains only abstract classes and variables, and therefore cannot be instantiated. It is intended only for using as a base for extending new classes. In our previous Weapon-example, our abstract class could look like this:

![AbsClass](/assets/lecture_6/AbstractClass.png)

See how it is declared in much the same way as an interface. The difference with an abstract class is that it can include constructors and class fields just like ordinary classes. It just can't be used to instantiate new objects, but instead has to be extended by a child class. To extend an abstract class as a child class, just use the normal `extends` keyword:

![AbsClassImplementation](/assets/lecture_6/AbstractClassImplementation.png)

The end result in this case is very similar. We can now create `Sword`-class objects that also belong to the `Weapon` type. Abstract classes and interfaces can be used similarly, but have different niches.

## Choosing between interfaces and abstract classes
* Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:
    - You want to share code among several closely related classes.
    - You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).
    - You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.
* Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:
    - You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.
    - You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.
    - You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.
