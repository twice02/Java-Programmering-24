# Lecture 2.6 - Classes - Shadowing and This
## Shadowing
Sometimes, a local method variable or an input argument will have the same name as an instance variable that already exists in the current scope. In such a case, the local varaible <i>shadows</i> the instance variable. This means that the local variable takes precedence. Consider our `Walrus` class. Let's say we create a method that takes an input `weight` and adds that to the walrus' current weight:

![addWeight](/assets/lecture_2/addWeight.PNG)

Now, what's going to be the returned value when we invoke this method with the input argument `25`?

![outputAddWeight](/assets/lecture_2/outputAddWeight.PNG)

The local variable `weight`, provided as an input argument to `addWeight()` <i>shadows</i> the instance field `weight`. What we intended to do was to add up the instance field `weight` and the input argument `weight`, but because of shadowing, we just ended up adding the input argument `weight` to itself! A simple solution to this would of course be to just rename our input argument to e.g. `addedWeight`: 

![addWeightRename](/assets/lecture_2/addWeightRename.PNG) 

![addWeightRenameOutput](/assets/lecture_2/addWeightRenameOutput.PNG)

Indeed, that does work. However, many times this is just inconvenient or confusing. Coordinate inputs for example, are very logically named `x` and `y`, but could very well shadow other instances of `x` and `y`. Coming up with names like `newX` or `localX` or `oldY` might sound clever initially, but usually leads to a lot of confusion in the long run. Luckily, there is a more elegant solution to using instance variables and local variables with the same name; the keyword `this`.

### This
The `this` keyword simply refers to the currently active object. In the above case, we can use `this` to refer to the `weight` of the walrus object which we are invoking `getWeight()` upon:

![addWeightThis](/assets/lecture_2/addWeightThis.PNG)

![addWeightRenameOutput](/assets/lecture_2/addWeightRenameOutput.PNG)

Here, `this` means that we first take the `weight` value of the current object (`abraham`), and then add it to the `weight` value in the input argument (the local varaible). `this` is used a lot in object-oriented languages, and can also be called e.g. `self`. Don't worry if it feels abstract, we will get tons of experience using `this` further on in the course. In fact, it will make an appearance already in the next section!
