# Lecture 1.1 - Variables
## JShell
In Java, traditionally there is no way of evaluating simple expressions in a terminal prompt. Everything needs to be written in a java source-file, compiled into bytecode, and then executed by the JVM. Luckily for us, we live in the 21st century, and Java now has an executable REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) terminal prompt called <i>jshell</i>. To run jshell, simply type `jshell` in your terminal of choice. You can run jshell in the terminal prompt in VSCode! It will take a couple of seconds, and eventually you should see something like this:

Using jshell, it is easy to test and evaluate things like variable assignments, logical statements and even multi-row loops. We will be using jshell extensively during the first part of this course when we take a look at variable declaration, simple types and statements.

## Variables and constants
A <i>variable</i> is a name given to a physical location in memory where information is stored. Variables store information that you plan to change and/or reuse over time. We saw an example of a variable in our HelloJava program from lecture 0. In line 5 (`JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hello, Java!");`) we declared a new variable `frame`, and then loaded it with a new instance of the `JFrame` class. We will get to instantiation of class objects later on. For now, just focus on the left-hand part `Jframe frame`. This means that we declare a variable `frame` of type `JFrame`.

### Declaring a variable
Let's declare a simpler variable in jshell! To <i>declare</i> a variable, we write e.g. `int x;`. Here, `int` is the <i>type</i> given to the variable (in this case integer, i.e. whole numbers), and `x` is the variable name. 

Side-note: You will probably have noticed by now that we end a lot of our rows with a semi-colon (;). In Java (just like in C), the semi-colon declares the end of a statement. There will be more about statements in lecture L1.3 - Statements. (In jshell, you actually don't have to use semi-colon, since every line is a single statement unless otherwise specified, but it's a good practice as it is required by the java-compiler). Well, back to the variable declaration, type the declaration in jshell and notice what happens.

jshell accepted your input, and printed the declaration for you. In this case, jshell also assigned a default value to your variable, 0. The default value is based on the type of variable that you enter. In our case, the variable type is <i>integer</i>, declared by the code-snippet `int`.

### Variable naming
Let's take a short de-tour here and talk about naming conventions. 

We have declared our variable `x`. `x` is a fine name for a variable that holds information about e.g. coordinate position in a coordinate system. However, in most cases, it would be wise to use a very descriptive name for your variable. In the early days of computer science, memory was very limited, and so, variable names tended to be very short to conserve memory. Today, we rarely have that problem, meaning we can have very long and informative variable names. 

Java has certain naming rules that determine what is an allowed variable name and what isn't. A variable name is <b>always case sensitive</b>. It can contain any sequence of alphanumerical characters (letters and digits) (including the dollar sign (`$`) and the underscore (`_`)), but must <b>always start with a letter</b>. Technically a variable name can start with a dollar sign or underscore as well, but this is generally considered bad practice. Digits are not allowed as starting characters. Examples of allowed variable names are: `cylinders`, `customerCount` or `nr_legal_signatures`. Examples of disallowed variable names are: `2023StudentDirectory` (starts with a digit), `java-programming-course` (unallowed character `-`) or `returningCustomers%` (unallowed character `%`).

Consider that we want to create a variable that holds the number of students in our classroom at this moment. We could declare it as `int x;`, or as `int students;`. `students` while being slightly more informative than just `x`, still doesn't really say much to anyone who reads the code. Instead, let's use a descriptive variable name: `int StudentsInClassroom;`. Always attempt to make your code as <i>readable</i> as possible. It may be that someone needs to go through your code 2 years from now and understand what it does (the most likely situation is that that person is you yourself). If you have used a descriptive naming convention, much time will be spared!

The formatting that I used there, writing a compound word where each new word starts with a capital letter, is called <i>camel-casing</i>, due to the fact that the capital letters produce "bumps", similar to those on the back of a camel. Usually, the first word is not capitalised. `thisIsAnExampleOfCamelCasing`. Other common ways of using descriptive names is e.g. using underscores: `this_is_naming_using_underscores_`.

### Assigning values
So now we have declared our new variable `numberStudentsInClassroom`. Now, we are obviously not 0 students in this classroom, so we want to assign some value to our variable instead of the default 0. This is done using the assignment <i>operator</i> `=`. Let's say we are 30 students in the classroom, and we want to assign that value to our newly declared variable. Input the following into jshell (your variable is still stored as long as the terminal is not closed) `numberStudentsInClassroom = 30;`. Note here that you don't need to specify the variable type now, that's already stored in memory.

![assign_value](/assets/lecture_1/assign_value.png)

There we go! We properly assigned a new value to our variable. Changing the value of a variable is as easy as just doing a new assignment. Let's say some of the students slept in this morning, and arrived only after the first break; we are now 35 students in the classroom. Now we need to update the value in our variable. `numberStudentsInClassroom = 35;`.

![assign_value2](/assets/lecture_1/assign_value2.png)

We can also use variables to assign values to each other. Let's create a new variable called `numberStudentsInClassroomMorning` for our earlier value of 30. `int numberStudentsInClassroomMorning = 30;`. Here, I utilized a time-saving trick in Java, that you are allowed to assign a value to your variable in the same statement as your declaration. See how that last segment actually combined the two statements `int numberStudentsInClassroomMorning;` and `numberStudentsInClassroomMorning = 30;`. This is often used to save space and to improve readability of your code.

Now, we can actually use our newly declared variable to change the value of our old one. Simply assign the new variable value to the old variable like this `numberStudentsInClassroom = numberStudentsInClassroomMorning;`.

Of course, this is a bit of a contrived example. But you will see the usefulness of this as soon as you start creating your own programs!

## Constants
In Java, variables can be declared as constants. A constant variable cannot change its value. in our `HelloJava` example, we used a constant called `JLabel.CENTER`, which held the value for the center of the window. Another example of a constant is Math.PI, which holds the value for pi (3.141592653589793). One reason for using a constant is that it just downright easier to type `Math.PI` instead of remembering all those decimals of pi. But an even better use of constants is if a value is used in multiple places across your code. Then changing that value means just changing the constant. To declare a variable as a constant, we use the <i>visibility modifiers</i> `static` and `final`. This is one of the functionalities of Java that don't work very well in jshell, so let's not do that now. We will get back to visibility modifiers later on in the course!

Let's try to modify a constant and see what happens!

Aha! jshell is clever enough to understand that we are not allowed to change the value of a constant (a `final` variable), so it gives us an error message. 

## Types
For our first few variables, we have only declared variables of type `int` (integers). In the next section, we will look at other data types, and try to understand what consequence data types has on Java programming.
