# Codealong 2.1 - Printing to terminal
Printing to the terminal is a fundamental way to display output in programming. Printouts can help users to understand what the program is doing, or can assist developers during program execution.

In Java, printing to the terminal is handled via the `System` class. To print to the terminal, invoke the static methods `System.out.print()` or `System.out.print()`. The difference between the two is whether include a <i>newline</i> character (`\n`) after the printout or not. `System.out.print()` prints text without a newline character, `System.out.println()` adds a newline character after printing.

## Printing text
To print text to using `System.out`, add the message to be printed as a `String` inside the parentheses: `System.out.println("Hello, my name is David.");`.

 You can use the concatenation operator `+` to concatenate multiple strings together: `System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + "David.");`

You can also concatenate Strings with variables:

### Escape characters
Just like with ordinary strings you can use the escape character `\` to create special characters such as newline (`\n`) or tab (`\t`).
