# Lecture 3.5 - Main
With the introduction of `static`, we have now defined all of the keywords used in the call to our `main()` method.

The `main()` method is called by the Java Virtual Machine when a compiled class is executed. If there is no `main()`, or if it is not correctly defined, an error will be produced. The call to `main()` is always the same:

`public static void main(String[] args) {}`

Let's go through the components!
<ul>
<li><code>main()</code> is a method, whose name is <code>main</code>.</li>
<li><code>main()</code> is <code>public</code>, meaning that it can be invoked from outside of its class. This is necessary in order for the Java Virtual Machine to be able to access it.</li>
<li><code>main()</code> is <code>static</code>, meaning that we do not need to instantiate an object of our class to call on <code>main()</code>.</li>
<li><code>main()</code> returns <code>void</code>, meaning that it does not produce any output value.</li>
<li><code>main()</code> takes a <code>String</code>-type argument named <code>args</code> as input argument(s). (We have not yet talked about the <code>[]</code> here, but they specify that <code>args</code> can be a list of strings instead of just a single string.)</li>
