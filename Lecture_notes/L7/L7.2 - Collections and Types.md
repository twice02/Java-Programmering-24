# Lecture 5.3 - Collections and Types
Remember how when we created an `Array` we specificed what type the Array contains? Recall the basic code for creating an array of Strings: `String[] myStrings = new String[5];`. This line creates an array of size 5 that will hold String-type elements. If we try to add any other kind of object to the array, we will get an error. Let's pop quickly into jshell and investigate it:

![arrayType](/assets/lecture_5/arrayType.png)

See how there is an error saying that the types are not compatible. The integer 45 cannot be converted into a String, and therefore cannot be inserted into the array. Now, imagine `myStrings` was a `List` instead of an `Array`, does the same still hold?

![listType](/assets/lecture_5/listType.png)

Yes and no! Java gives us a warning, that we are trying to insert an object of a specific type into a List with non-specified type. But it still works! See at the bottom how our `List` has accepted both a String and an integer as elements of the list. This sounds convenient, we can just use lists to store all kinds of objects in them! Well, while it is flexible, it is also dangerous. Remember how Java is quite statically typed, and cares a lot about what type an object belongs to? If we invoke a method on the elements of our list, we better make sure that the method works for any kind of object, or we will produce an error! To handle these kinds of problems, Java provides a way to create <i>type-specific</i> collections.

## Setting the type of a collection
To set the type of a collection, we use angular brackets (`<>`) after our collection declaration, just as we use the normal brackets (`[]`) to declare an Array. If we e.g. want to declare a `String` type `List`, we type: `List<String> myStrings;`. The full one-line instantiation looks like this: `List<String> myStrings = new ArrayList<>();`. 

![listStringType](/assets/lecture_5/listStringType.png)

See how our `List` is now instantiated as `String` type, and this does not accept any elements that do not belong to (or can be cast into) `String`. In practice, this is almost always how collections are implemented. Keeping strict control of types reduces the risks of future errors tremendously!

Let's see another example of typing a collection. Well create a `Map` that holds information about horses in a stable. Each horse is its own `Horse` object, and it has a certain `id`, represented by an integer:

![horses](/assets/lecture_5/horses.png)

First, we create an empty `Horse` class. Then we create our `Map` and instantiate its types using `Integer` as key, and `Horse` as value. We then create a new id for our first horse, and a `Horse` object for it. Notice here how the collections API doesn't use the primitive types (`int`, `char`, etc.) but instead requires the full `Integer` class as type. We initialized the `Map` using the `HashMap` class, which is a generic class for the `Map` interface, similar to what `ArrayList` is for arrays.

Next, we use the `put()` method to add a new key:value pair to our map, consisting of our id (`horse1_id`) and our `Horse` object (`horse1`). We receive a `null` return, indicating that the key was not occupied. Now, when we check our ´myHorses´ variable, it shows us our new key:value pair (`101=Horse@dc24521`). Finally, we use the `get()` method to retreive the value of the key `101`.
