# Lecture 5.1 - Arrays
So far we have talked about variables that hold single values, be it either primitive type values, or references to objects. Another kind of very useful type of object is the <i>Array</i>. An array is a type of object intended to hold multiple values. An individual value in an array is called an <i>element</i>. The length of an array is its <i>length</i>, and it is a fixed value that cannot be changed once it's been initialized. You can create arrays for all of Javas data types, including reference types such as `String` or `JLabel`. This means we can actually create an array of walruses using our newly created `Walrus` class!

## Declaring an array
To declare an array, we use the same variable instatiation call as for singular variables, but with the added brackets `[]`:

![initArray](/assets/lecture_5/initArray.png)

Here we declare first an array of type `char`, with the name `charArray`, and next we declare an array of type `Walrus` with the name `walrusArray`. An array can <b>never hold elements of more than one type</b>!


### C-style initialization
The preferred format of declaring an array is the above `{type}[] {name}`, however, Java will also accept the brackets after the variable name, as is convention in C: `{type} {name}[]`. Therefore, the two statements `String[] args` and `String args[]` are identical. You will recognize this as the argument for the call to `main()`. In fact, some Java developers prefer to use the C-style `String args[]` in their call to `main()`, although Java-style `String[] args` is the convention. Both variants are accepted by the Java compiler.

## Creating an array
To create an acutal instance of the array, just like for singular variables, we use the `new` keyword, along with our intended object type (primitive or reference), and a set of brackets including the length of our array.

Here, we create an array of 3 `char` elements. Since we did not provide any initial values for the elements, they were automatically assigned with the default character `\000` (unicode for `null`). The length value inside the brackets is a statement, meaning that we can do computations in there aswell if necessary:

![instanceArrayStatement](/assets/lecture_5/instanceArrayStatement.png)

We can of course combine the declaring and creating step in the same way as for simple variables:

![initInstanceArray](/assets/lecture_5/initInstanceArray.png)

See how the 3 elements in our array were all assigned the value `null`. This is because all of the elements in an array of objects are reference values, not objects in themselves. This is exactly the same as for singular reference type variables. Remember how a variable holds only a reference to an object, and not the object itself. An array holds an array of references, not the objects themselves. Thus, when we create our array, Java assigns all reference values the default value `null`.

## Accessing the elements of an array
To access an element of an array, we use bracket notation, as in many other programming languages. The elements in an array start counting from `0`, the first element is therefore accessed by `{arrayName}[0]`, or in our case: `walrusArray[0]`.

![accessArray](/assets/lecture_5/accessArray.png)

Notice how the last call to `walrusArray[3]` produces an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because even though the length of the array is 3, since it starts at `0`, the last element will actually be `2`. 

We can also use this way to assign values to our arrays, e.g. `walrusArray[0] = new Walrus()`.

![assignElement](/assets/lecture_5/assignElement.png)

## Direct assignment of array values
Another way to assign values is to do so immediately upon array creation by using curly braces (`{}`):

![oddNumbers](/assets/lecture_5/oddNumbers.png)

Here, we declare a new array of type `int[]` and give it the name `oddNumbers`, we then immediately assign it 5 values, consisting of the odd digits between 0 and 10. The array is immediately created and populated with values, which we can access using `oddNumbers[]`.

We can do the same for our object array of walruses, however, we must also provide the `new` keyword for each element. `new` is technically required for primitive types as well, but Java is able to infer it.

![walrusArray](/assets/lecture_5/walrusArray.png)

See how we used the multiple constructors that we created for our `Walrus` class. We let the first element be created as a default walrus, and let the second be created using the full constructor, and supply all of its values as arguments. Accessing our objects in our walrus array is the same as for the previous int-array. Notice how `walrusArray[0]` simply gives the reference to the particular `Walrus` object. `walrusArray[1].name` will access first the second element of the array (remember they always start at `0`!), and then accesses the name field of that object. Objects in arrays work just like any other objects, meaning we can invoke their methods from within the array:
