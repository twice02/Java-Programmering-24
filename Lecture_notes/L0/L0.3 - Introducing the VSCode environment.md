# Demonstration 2.1 - Introducing the VSCode enironment
This demonstration is intended to get you quickly started with using VSCode as your IDE for developing Java code.

### Recap!
We will be using an integrated development environment (IDE). An IDE is a graphical software that provides additional functionalities related to programming in specific programming languages. Some IDEs are specialized towards one language, whereas others support multiple languages. Modern IDEs can usually handle multiple aspects of software development, including writing source code, debugging, version control, etc.<br>

In this course, we will be using VSCode, which is distributed under a free license by Microsoft. VSCode is a flexible and lightweight IDE, suitable for development in many different languages. It operates on a basic platform, upon which you can incorporate extensions to work with e.g. different programming languages.

## VSCode
VSCode is intended to be light-weight and easy to use. It doesn't have a ton of built-in functionalities like other popular IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ), but it runs very smoothly and is perfect for a beginner developer. VSCode is also very modular, meaning that if you want some extra functionality, you can usually download and install an extension for that. The Java bundle that we installed together with VSCode comes with a few Java-related extension pre-installed.

On the left-hand side is your navigator menu where you can open up navigation options and extensions on your left sidebar. Using this menu you can move between various functions in VSCode. The one you will likely be using the most is top one that looks like two documents. It is your <i>Explorer</i>, and will give you an overview of all the files in your current project. If you have initialized your project by cloning the course GitHub repository (to recap, go <a href="Lecture_notes\D1.1 - Introducing Git and GitHub.md">here</a>) you will see your entire repository mapped out in the Explorer.

Other useful buttons here include the <i>Search</i> function, where you can search your entire code-base for specific segments. And the Source Control System (sometimes called Version Control System) navigator, where you can perform all your Git commands directly in your IDE. This is very useful when it comes to tracing your commits and pushing/pulling/fetching/merging to and from your repository. There's actually a test function as well! You'll find it if you click on the Erlenmayer flask icon (it's probably supposed to relate to an experiment). You need to enable it first though, and we will not do that in this first course. In the {insert course name} course you will utilize the test function in VSCode!

## Working with text files in VSCode
Your primary working window will be your text editor, this is where you write your code. Click on the <i>File</i> menu in the top left-hand corner of the VSCode window, and select <i>New file...</i>. Select <i>New Java Class</i> in the drop-down menu, and choose a name for you new class-file. For now, let's name it `MyFirstClass`. VSCode will open your new class-file immediately in a new tab. You will see a list of all your currently open files in the top middle of your window. It might look something like this:

VSCode keeps all of your files open as tabs in this part of the IDE, and you can always shut those down that you are not currently working with. It will ask you whether you want to save your changes or not. In the top right-hand corner you will find some functionalities related to your working window. You can e.g. compare your current file to the latest version in your Git repository, or you can split your text editor window so that you can compare two files against each other. You will make more use of these functions later on as we create more advanced applications.

## The text editor window
Immediately when your new class file is opened, you will notice some of the perks of using an IDE instead of a simple text editor such as Notepad. You will see that VSCode automatically declared a class in your file. This is because you told it that you were creating a .java-file. By <b>very strong</b> convention, a Java class has the same name as the .java-file it resides in, so VSCode decided to create that class for you. Depending on what folder you created your file in, VSCode may also have added your class-file to a package. If your file is in the source directory of your current project, it will not do this. In my case here, I created the .java-file in the `lecture_notes` folder, so VSCode added it to the package `lecture_notes`.

You will also notice that the different keywords and operators are colour-coded. the IDE does this in order for the code to be more organised and readable. The default colour scheme is <i>Dark Modern</i>, but you can easily change this by navigating to <i>File</i>-><i>Preferences</i>-><i>Theme</i>-><i>Color Theme</i>. Try using a few of the other colour schemes, and settle on one that suits you. Generally, dark backgrounds are recommended when developing, as white backgrounds tend to be harsher on the eyes when you sit for extended periods of time in front of a computer screen. Dark backgrounds also contrast colours better, making more use of the code colouring!

We will not talk that much more about VSCode right now, but rather back in to the creation of classes. But there are tons of functionalities even in a light-weight IDE such as VSCode. If you need to do anything, it is likely that you can do so, although it may require installation of an extension. You CAN of course write fully functional Java classes in Notepad (after all, it's just text!), but you will have none of the benefits that comes with a modern, powerful, multi-faceted IDE.
